# libft

The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that youâ€™ll be allowed to use in all your other projects.

## Project Description

Here at 42 Silicon Valley, it is forbidden for students to use any other function other than C system calls or did not write themselves.  Therefore, the first project as a student is to write every function in the C standard libary.  This library will give students access to useful functions that will be used in future projects. They're are also encouraged to continue adding their own personal functions as they progress.
